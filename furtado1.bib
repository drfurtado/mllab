	abstract = {Anti-fat bias by professors in physical education departments may interfere with the training provided to pre-service teachers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes of professors in physical education departments toward obese individuals. Professors from randomly selected institutions across all four US regions participated in the study (N = 94). Participants took the Implicit Association Test and answered the Anti-Fat Attitude Scale and two questions specifically designed to measure their attitudes toward physical education teachers and majors who are obese. The participants exhibited implicit good–bad (p {\textless} .001) and lazy–motivated (p {\textless} .001) anti-fat biases. Professors favored accepting majors who are obese (p {\textless} .001), but they strongly disapproved of obese physical education teachers as role models to their students (p {\textless} .001). Explicit anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval of physical education teachers who are obese as role models to students (p {\textless} .001) and accepting majors who are obese (p {\textless} .001). Implicit good–bad anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval of obese physical education teachers as role models to students (p = .047). The anti-fat bias demonstrated by the professors may negatively affect the training of pre-service physical education teachers to work with students of all body sizes. Awareness programs may be necessary to diminish anti-fat bias among professors in physical education teacher education programs.},

	abstract = {Fundamental movement skills (FMS) play a crucial role in a child’s motor skill development, as their mastery is related to the acquisition and mastery of specialized sport skills and to a child’s general health through the prevention of weight gain and increased level of physical activity. Thus, the accurate and reliable measurement of FMS is of related importance. This article presents the results of two studies intended to assess expert-rater agreement and inter-/intrarater scoring reliability in the administration of a new observational FMS instrument, the Furtado–Gallagher Computerized Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System (FG-COMPASS). In Study 1, we found that four of the six scales that underwent modifications in a previous study yielded acceptable expert agreement, permitting their retention in the revised test, while the two remaining scales measuring side sliding and leaping yielded insufficient expert agreement, leading to their removal from the test. In Study 2, weighted kappa values reflected very good interrater agreement among three raters across two test administrations for the Locomotor and Manipulative subtests and the Total score (all skills combined). Future studies should (a) collect validity and reliability evidence for two additional skills planned for inclusion in the Locomotor subtest, (b) assess the impact of varying the number of trials given when assessing motor skill performances in life settings, and (c) test the feasibility of the web-based training tool and mobile version of the instrument., Fundamental movement skills (FMS) play a crucial role in a child’s motor skill development, as their mastery is related to the acquisition and mastery of specialized sport skills and to a child’s general health through the prevention of weight gain and increased level of physical activity.

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that older athletes within age groupings are often perceived to be more talented simply due to advanced maturity, leading to biased selection in higher levels of sports competition, now commonly termed relative age effect (RAE). This study’s goals were to determine whether (a) RAE influenced the selection of junior college baseball participants and (b) academic timing (Glamser \& Marciani, 1992), in which academic status determines age groupings more than strict age guidelines for college sports, influenced the formation of RAE. Participants were 150 junior college baseball players. Our results showed that RAE was only a significant factor, comparing the birth distribution of participants born before and after the midpoint of the participation year, when academic timing was also a factor in determining age groupings. In addition, the birth rate distribution, though not significantly different than expected, was greater only when those participants born during the expected participation year were included. The results of this study indicate that RAE could bear more influence among American student-athletes than was previously reported in that RAE in conjunction with academic timing does influence the selection of collegiate athletes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To verify the association of motor skills with habitual and organized PA participation, and sedentary behavior for males and females. METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional design in a sample of seventy-six second graders from a public elementary school in a Midwestern State. RESULTS: Mann Whitney and t-tests indicated gender differences in FMS and PA variables. Spearman correlation analyses demonstrated that habitual PA was correlated to total FMS, and manipulative skills for boys. For girls, a significant association was present in organized PA and locomotor skills. CONCLUSION: Choice of organized physical activity seems to influence the development of FMS and affect habitual PA behavior differently in boys and girls.},

	abstract = {Attention is very important for learning. Children are known for not paying much attention due to lack of selective attention resources. Selective attention is the ability to direct the attentional focus to a specific point in the environment, in order to pay attention to what is relevant (Ladewig et all, 2001). One way to assist children to pay more attention while teaching a task, is by using cues, that are one or two words, short phrases, with higher meaning to the learner. The objective of the current study was to test the efficacy of the cues, while school children performed the backhand. The statistical results of the retention test have shown, after 20 days rest without any practice, very high levels of significance in favor of the cue group, which was even able to increase the mean average from the post-test. On the other hand, children that did not receive cues had a decrease in performance in all six technical factors, from the post-test to the retention. In conclusion, the use of learning cues was very effective in assisting children to learn the backhand. Future research must continue to explore the use of cues, while teaching different motor skills in different contexts.},
