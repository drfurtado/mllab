We are interested in (1) examining the impact of an acute bout of intense endurance exercise (iEE) on motor-perceptual learning in children, (2) assessing whether fitness level matters for motor learning, and (3) evaluating brain activity during such learning. We will examine these questions in children with and without developmental coordination disorder, and in adults.
