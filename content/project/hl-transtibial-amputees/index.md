Objective: This study seeks to determine the balance control mechanisms and muscle activation patterns in those with lower-limb amputation practicing yoga. When compared to those without amputation, these data can be used to create adapted yoga programs for this population in the future. This study was performed as part of Nicole Stoehr's thesis.
