This project aims to identify prevalence of motor skill deficits and to verify the nature of the associations between the proficiency of basic motor skills with sociodemographic, anthropometric variables, perception of competence, physical fitness and school performance among elementary school students from the municipal public schools in the city of Marechal Cândido Rondon-PR (Brazil).
