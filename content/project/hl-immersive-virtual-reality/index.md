 Objective: In this project, we seek to determine how use of virtual reality (VR) headsets influences the visual system’s ability to focus on targets and how that impacts learning of skills in a virtual world. Since the use of VR is becoming more widespread, it is important to know how learning of motor skills in a virtual world differs on a visual and biomechanical level compared to learning the same skill in the real world.
