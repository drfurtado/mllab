summary: 2015 WSKW Annual Conference - Dobbs, I.; Kohli, D.; Furtado Jr., O.   
abstract: Teachers and practitioners working with younger children must conduct regular assessments to gather evidence about the student's level of achievement in fundamental movement skill (FMS) development (e.g., skipping, throwing, etc.). However, assessment tools designed to test FMSs require teachers to videotape performances for later analysis. This practice poses a problem for the teacher considering the time available for assessment and the number of students per class. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of classification decisions for a new method of assessing the qualitative aspects of FMS competence in children by comparing agreement between an expert rater and 29 trained undergraduate kinesiology students. The method proposed in this study will allow teachers to conduct live assessments without the need to videotape students. The significance of this project is twofold. First, it will allow teachers to engage in regular assessments of students. By conducting assessments regularly, teachers will have the opportunity to detect problems regarding fundamental movement skill development. Abnormal FMS development has been linked to unwanted levels of obesity and low levels of physical activity participation among children and adolescents. Second, this method will allow instructors at the college level to provide more opportunities for students who are pursuing teaching certification in elementary education to practice assessing fundamental movement skill performance. Participants were 29 undergraduate students enrolled in a kinesiology program. Participants used adapted versions of validated developmental sequences to classify 24 videos of children performing the skills of hopping and striking with a bat. Fundamental movement skill developmental sequences are comprised of pictorial configurations and written performance criteria of the skill. During training, participants relied on both the pictorial configurations and the written performance criteria to classify 8 videos per skill; while during testing, participants relied only on the pictorial configurations to classify 12 videos per each skill. During training, participants received feedback from the test administrator. Subjects were tested 48 hours after the training session with no feedback given. Participant's ratings were compared with those of an expert rater. The weighted kappa values indicate that agreement was considered "very good" for hopping (kw=.88, SE= .018) and "good" for batting (kw=.80, SE= .033). The current study served as the foundation for the development of a new assessment tool designed to test fundamental movement skill competency in children.
