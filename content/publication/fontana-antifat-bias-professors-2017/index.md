abstract: Anti-fat bias by professors in physical education departments may interfere
  with the training provided to pre-service teachers. The purpose of this study was
  to evaluate the attitudes of professors in physical education departments toward
  obese individuals. Professors from randomly selected institutions across all four
  US regions participated in the study (N = 94). Participants took the Implicit Association
  Test and answered the Anti-Fat Attitude Scale and two questions specifically designed
  to measure their attitudes toward physical education teachers and majors who are
  obese. The participants exhibited implicit good–bad (p textless .001) and lazy–motivated
  (p textless .001) anti-fat biases. Professors favored accepting majors who are obese
  (p textless .001), but they strongly disapproved of obese physical education teachers
  as role models to their students (p textless .001). Explicit anti-fat bias was associated
  with a stronger disapproval of physical education teachers who are obese as role
  models to students (p textless .001) and accepting majors who are obese (p textless
  .001). Implicit good–bad anti-fat bias was associated with a stronger disapproval
  of obese physical education teachers as role models to students (p = .047). The
  anti-fat bias demonstrated by the professors may negatively affect the training
  of pre-service physical education teachers to work with students of all body sizes.
  Awareness programs may be necessary to diminish anti-fat bias among professors in
  physical education teacher education programs.
