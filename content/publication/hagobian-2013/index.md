abstract: Acute exercise suppresses relative energy intake; however, it remains unclear
  whether this occurs in both men and women exposed to the same relative exercise
  treatment. Eleven healthy men (22 ± 2 years; 16% ± 6% body fat (BF); 26 ± 4 body
  mass index (BMI); 42.9 ± 6.5 mL˙kg-1˙min-1peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak)) and
  10 healthy women (21 ± 2 years; 24 ± 2 BMI; 23% ± 3% BF; 39.9 ± 5.5 mL˙kg-1˙min-1VO2peak)
  rested for 60 min or exercised on a cycle ergometer at 70%VO2peakuntil 30% of total
  daily energy expenditure was expended (men, expenditure = 975 ± 195 kcal in 82 ±
  13 min; women, expenditure = 713 ± 86 kcal in 84 ± 17 min) in a counterbalanced,
  crossover fashion. Appetite hormones and appetite ratings were assessed in response
  to each condition. Forty minutes after both conditions, ad libitum total and relative
  energy intake (energy intake minus energy cost of exercise) were assessed at a buffet
  meal. There was no significant sex or condition effect in appetite hormones (PYY3-36,
  acylated ghrelin, insulin) and appetite ratings (hunger, satisfaction, fullness).
  Total energy intake in men was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in exercise and rest
  conditions (1648 ± 950, 1216 ± 633 kcal, respectively) compared with women (591
  ± 183, 590 ± 231 kcal, respectively). Relative energy intake was significantly lower
  (P < 0.05) after exercise compared with rest in men (672 ± 827, 1133 ± 619 kcal,
  respectively) and women (-121 ± 243, 530 ± 233 kcal, respectively). These data highlight
  the effectiveness of acute exercise to suppress relative energy intake regardless
  of sex.
