abstract: Background The relative contribution of sensory inputs to control balance
  while standing is dynamically adjusted. These sensory reweighting processes could
  be impacted by age and sport expertise capabilities, especially when the sport emphasizes
  equilibrium like artistic gymnastics. Research question The aim of this study was
  to explore the sensory reweighting processes to adjust standing posture in children
  and adults with different gymnastic expertise (gymnasts, G, and non-gymnast, NG).
  Methods All participants were asked to stand quietly on a force plate in two visual
  conditions (eyes open, EO, and eyes closed, EC). Within a trial, proprioception
  was altered with two vibrators strapped at the Achilles tendon level. The center
  of pressure (COP) displacements in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions
  were calculated and normalized by the base of support. The effect of vibration application
  was characterized by the COP speed, maximal posterior displacement and the time
  when it occurred. The effect of vibration removal was depicted by the time between
  the motor switched off and the achievement of balance values similar to baseline
  and the COP speed and movement units performed during this time. Results G children
  presented shorter posterior displacement during vibrations, needed less time to
  recover initial balance, and produced less movements units than NG children. In
  general, adults and EO showed better reweighting responses than children and EC,
  respectively. Significance These results suggest that age could have a positive
  effect on reweighting processes and that gymnastic experience may benefit the development
  of proprioceptive reweighting processes in children but not in adults.
