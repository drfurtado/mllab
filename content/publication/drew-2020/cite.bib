 abstract = {Advancements in virtual reality (VR) technology now allow for the creation of highly immersive virtual environments and for systems to be commercially available at an affordable price. Despite increased availability, this access does not ensure that VR is appropriate for training for all motor skills. Before the implementation of VR for training sport-related skills takes place, it must first be established whether VR utilization is appropriate. To this end, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms that drive learning in these new environments which will allow for optimization of VR to best facilitate transfer of learned skills to the real world. In this study we sought to examine how a skill acquired in VR compares to one acquired in the real world (RW), utilizing training to complete a dart-throwing task in either a virtual or real environment. We adopted a perceptual-motor approach in this study, employing measures of task performance (i.e., accuracy), as well as of perception (i.e., visual symptoms and oculomotor behavior) and motor behaviors (i.e., throwing kinematics and coordination). Critically, the VR-trained group performed significantly worse in terms of throwing accuracy compared to both the RW-trained group and their own baseline performance. In terms of perception, the VR-trained group reported greater acute visual symptoms compared to the RW-trained group, though oculomotor behaviors were largely the same across groups. In terms of motor behaviors, the VR-trained group exhibited different dart-throwing kinematics during training, but in the follow-up test adapted their throwing pattern to one similar to the RW-trained group. In total, VR training impaired real-world task performance, suggesting that virtual environments may offer different learning constraints compared to the real world. These results thus emphasize the need to better understand how some elements of virtual learning environments detract from transfer of an acquired sport skill to the real world. Additional work is warranted to further understand how perceptual-motor behaviors are acquired differently in virtual spaces.},
