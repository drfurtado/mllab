abstract: Fundamental movement skills (FMS) are considered the building blocks
  for the development of specialized skills (Gabbard, 2007). In addition, FMS
  competency has been linked to decreased levels of obesity (Lopes et al., 2012)
  and increased levels of physical activity/sport participation (Castelli &
  Valley, 2007). Thus, teachers and practitioners working with younger children
  must conduct regular assessments to gather evidence about the student’s level
  of achievement in FMS development. This study aimed to collect evidence for
  concurrent validity, reliability of classification decisions, and inter/intra
  rater reliability for the FG-COMPASS. The FG-COMPASS is a process-oriented and
  criterion-referenced instrument that assesses FMS development in children ages
  5 to 10 years. The Test of Gross Motor Development 2 (TGMD-2) was used as the
  “gold standard” for concurrent validity. Participants were 34 children between
  the ages of 5 and 10 years. Pearson partial correlations (controlling for age)
  comparing the scores of both tests indicate a moderate to strong correlation
  for locomotion (rxy.z =.52, p < .01), object manipulation (rxy.z =.59, p <
  .001), and total scores (rxy.z =.63, p < .001). The reliability of
  classification decisions was assessed by comparing the live score ratings of
  five raters with the primary investigator’s video scores on 10 randomly
  selected children per skill. The inter-rater reliability was assessed by
  comparing the scores across the FG- COMPASS 5 raters. The intra-rater
  reliability was assessed by comparing each FG-COMPASS rater’s live scores to
  their video scores. The weighted kappa values ranged from .51 to .83, .50 to
  .89, and .60 to .87 for the reliability of classification decisions, inter and
  intra rater reliability, respectively. The results of this study provide
  further validity and reliability evidence for the FG- COMPASS. Further studies
  involving children with different ethnic backgrounds and larger sample sizes
  are recommended.
