abstract: 'textlesssection class=\"abstract\"textgreatertextlessptextgreaterWe assessed
  the effect of an acute intense exercise bout on the adaptation and consolidation
  of a visuomotor adaptation task in children. We also sought to assess if exercise
  and learning task presentation order could affect task consolidation. Thirty-three
  children were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) exercise before the
  learning task, (b) exercise after the learning task, and (c) only learning task.
  Baseline performance was assessed by practicing the learning task in a 0° rotation
  condition. Afterward, a 60° rotation-adaptation set was applied followed by three
  rotated retention sets after 1 hr, 24 hr, and 7 days. For the exercise groups, exercise
  was presented before or after the motor adaptation. Results showed no group differences
  during the motor adaptation while exercise seemed to enhance motor consolidation.
  Greater consolidation enhancement was found in participants who exercised before
  the learning task. Our data support the importance of exercise to improve motor-memory
  consolidation in children.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectiontextgreater'
