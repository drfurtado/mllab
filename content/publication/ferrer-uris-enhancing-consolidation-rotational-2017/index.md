abstract: 'We assessed the effect of a single bout of intense exercise on the adaptation
  and consolidation of a rotational visuomotor task, together with the effect of the
  order of exercise presentation relative to the learning task. Healthy adult participants
  (n = 29) were randomly allocated to one of three experimental groups: (1) exercise
  before task practice, (2) exercise after task practice, and (3) task practice only.
  After familiarization with the learning task, participants undertook a baseline
  practice set. Then, four 60° clockwise rotational sets were performed, comprising
  an adaptation set and three retention sets at 1 h, 24 h, and 7 days after the adaptation
  set. Depending on the experimental group, exercise was presented before or after
  the adaptation sets. We found that error reduction during adaptation was similar
  regardless of when exercise was presented. During retention, significant error reduction
  was found in the retention set at 1 h for both exercise groups, but this enhancement
  was not present during subsequent retention sets, with no differences present between
  exercise groups. We conclude that an acute bout of intense exercise could positively
  affect retention, although the order in which exercise is presented does not appear
  to influence its benefits during the early stages of consolidation.'
