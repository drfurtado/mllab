abstract: Motor learning textbooks provide specific recommendations for the use of
  whole and part practice during motor skill acquisition. Magill recommended basing
  decisions on Naylor and Briggs' hypothesis of task complexity and organization,
  while Schmidt and Wrisberg recommended basing decisions on skill classification.
  To evaluate the accuracy of these recommendations, a meta-analysis was conducted.
  Through a literature search, 44 articles were located, and 20 provided sufficient
  information to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were calculated using means
  for whole and part practice for acquisition and retention. Although several analyses
  were compromised by insufficient studies investigating whole and part practice,
  mean effect sizes generally supported motor learning textbooks. To better verify
  the empirical validity of recommendations for the use of whole and part practice,
  more studies are necessary.
