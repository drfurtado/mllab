abstract: 'Background Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects a large proportion of the
  population and has been associated with different muscle dysfunctions. However,
  there is no consensus regarding muscle electromyography and kinematic patterns during
  fatiguing tasks. Objective To examine whether trunk and limb muscle fatigability
  and activation patterns of individuals suffering CLBP differ from those of healthy
  participants during a holding task. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Clinical
  research laboratory. Participants Twenty-four participants with CLBP and 26 matched
  healthy controls. Methods Both groups performed a static holding task, in a semisquat
  position, until exhaustion. The performance variable was time to failure. Electromyography
  signs, such as median frequency and root mean square, were used to quantify fatigability
  by applying linear regression to each of the 3 successive test periods. Kinematic
  variables were monitored throughout the holding task. Main Outcome Measurements
  Independent t tests were used to compare time to failure. Electromyography-based
  measures of muscle fatigability were examined through a two-way, repeated-measures
  analysis of variance (mixed-model), whereas kinematic analysis was based on 2 multivariate
  analyses of variance. Results Although the groups differed in time to failure (healthy
  group: mean 201.6 seconds, SD 98.9 seconds; CLBP: mean 132.4 seconds, SD 78.9 seconds;
  P =.009), no statistically significant differences were found in electromyography-based
  measures of muscle fatigability, except for the internal oblique muscle. Kinematic
  variables were similar in the 2 groups. Conclusion Despite similar electromyography
  fatigability in the 2 groups, individuals with CLBP seem to be more sensitive to
  certain effects of back muscle fatigue. Significant differences in electromyography
  measurements in the internal oblique muscle, both between groups and across periods,
  suggest that individuals with CLBP trigger a subtly different activation pattern
  to control the spine. In a holding task, compared with healthy people, this may
  represent a compensatory behavior aimed at adapting to certain deficits in spine
  control or pain. Level of Evidence II'
