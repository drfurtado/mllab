abstract: To study the interplay between motor learning and emotional responses of
  young infants, we developed a contingent learning paradigm that included two related,
  difficult, operant tasks. We also coded facial expression to characterise emotional
  response to learning. In a sample of nine-month-old healthy Chinese infants, 44.7%
  achieved learning threshold during this challenging arm-conditioning test. Some
  evidence of learning was observed at the beginning of the second task. The lowest
  period of negative emotions coincided with the period of maximum movement responses
  after the initiation of the second task, and movement responses negatively correlated
  with the frequency of negative emotions. Positive emotions, while generally low
  throughout the task, increased during peak performance especially for learners.
  Peak frequency of movement responses was positively correlated with the frequency
  of positive emotions. Despite the weak evidence of learning this difficult task,
  our results from the learners would suggest that increasing positive emotions, and
  perhaps down-regulating negative emotional responses, may be important for improving
  performance and learning a complex operant task in infancy. Further studies are
  necessary to determine the role of emotions in learning difficult tasks in infancy.
