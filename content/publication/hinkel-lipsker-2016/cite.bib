 abstract = {© 2016, Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. The hip and ankle strategies that affect learning of a novel gait have not been fully determined, and could be of importance in design of clinical gait interventions. The authors' purpose was to determine the effects of asymmetric split-belt treadmill walking on ankle and hip work during propulsion. Participants were randomized into either a gradual training group or a sudden training group and later returned for a retention test. The gradual training group performed significantly more work at the hip joint of the slow limb during acquisition, and decreased the hip joint work performed during retention. These findings reveal the hip joint on the slow limb during initial swing as a possible site of adaptation to a novel locomotor pattern.},
