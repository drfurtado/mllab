abstract: 'Gait adaptation is a task that requires fine-tuned
  coordination of all degrees of freedom in the lower limbs by the central nervous
  system. However, when individuals change their gait it is unknown how this coordination
  is organized, and how it can be influenced by contextual interference during practice.
  Such knowledge could provide information about measurement of gait adaptation during
  rehabilitation. Able-bodied individuals completed an acute bout of asymmetric split-belt
  treadmill walking, where one limb was driven at a constant velocity and the other
  according to one of three designed practice paradigms: serial practice, where the
  variable limb belt velocity increased over time; random blocked practice, where
  every 20 strides the variable limb belt velocity changed randomly; random practice,
  where every stride the variable limb belt velocity changed randomly. On the second
  day, subjects completed one of two different transfer tests; one with a belt asymmetry
  close to that experienced on the acquisition day (transfer 1; 1.5:1), and one with
  a greater asymmetry (transfer 2; 2:1). To reduce this inherently high-dimensional
  dataset, principal component analyses were used for kinematic data collected throughout
  the acquisition and transfer phases; resulting in extraction of the first two principal
  components (PCs). For acquisition, PC1 and PC2 were related to sagittal and frontal
  plane control. For transfer 1, PC1 and PC2 were related to frontal plane control
  of the base of support and whole-body center of mass. For transfer 2, PC1 did not
  have any variables with high enough coefficients deemed to be relevant, and PC2
  was related to sagittal plane control. Observations of principal component scores
  indicate that variance structuring differs among practice groups during acquisition
  and transfer 1, but not transfer 2. These results demonstrate the main kinematic
  coordinative structures that exist during gait adaptation, and that control of sagittal
  plane and frontal plane motion are perhaps a trade-off during acquisition of a novel
  asymmetric gait pattern.'
