abstract: 'Current theories, like Ecological Dynamics, propose that inter-trial movement
  variability is functional when acquiring or refining movement coordination. Here,
  we examined how age-based experience levels of gymnasts constrained differences
  in emergent movement pattern variability during task performance. Specifically,
  we investigated different roles of movement pattern variability when gymnasts in
  different age groups performed longswings on a high bar, capturing the range of
  experience from beginner to advanced status. We also investigated the functionality
  of the relationships between levels of inter-trial variability and longswing amplitude
  during performance. One-hundred and thirteen male gymnasts in five age groups were
  observed performing longswings (with three different experience levels: beginners,
  intermediates and advanced performers). Performance was evaluated by analysis of
  key events in coordination of longswing focused on the arm-trunk and trunk-thigh
  segmental relations. Results revealed that 10 of 18 inter-trial variability measures
  changed significantly as a function of increasing task experience. Four of ten variability
  measures conformed to a U-shaped function with age implying exploratory strategies
  amongst beginners and functional adaptive variability amongst advanced performers.
  Inter-trial variability of arm-trunk coordination variables (6 of 10) conformed
  to a -shaped curve, as values were reduced to complete the longswings. Changes in
  coordination variability from beginner to intermediate status were largely restrictive,
  with only one variability measure related to exploration. Data revealed how inter-trial
  movement variability in gymnastics, relative to performance outcomes, needs careful
  interpretation, implying different roles as task experience changes.,    Key points    Inter-trial
  variability while performing longswings on a high bar was assessed in a large sample
  (113 participants) divided into five age groups (form beginners to advanced gymnasts).
  Longswing assessment allowed us to evaluate inter-trial variability in representative
  performance context.   Coordination variability presented two different configurations
  across experience levels depending on the variable of interest: either a U-shaped
  or a L- or -shaped graph.   Increased inter-trial variability of the functional
  phase events offered flexibility to adapt the longswing performance in the advanced
  gymnasts, while decreasing variability in arm-trunk coordination modes was critical
  to improve longswing and to achieve the most advanced level.   In addition, the
  relationship between variability measures and the global performance outcome (i.e.
  the swing amplitude) revealed different functional roles of movement variability
  (exploratory or restrictive) as a function of changes in experience levels.'
