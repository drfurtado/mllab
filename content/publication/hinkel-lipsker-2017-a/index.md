abstract: 'When humans make errors
  in stepping during walking due to a perturbation, they may adapt their gait as a
  way to correct for discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory feedback.
  This study sought to determine if increased contextual interference during acquisition
  of a novel asymmetric gait pattern would change lower-limb mechanical strategies
  generalized to different walking contexts. Such knowledge could help to clarify
  the role of contextual interference in locomotor adaptation, and demonstrate potential
  use in future gait rehabilitation paradigms. One belt on a split-belt treadmill
  was driven at a constant velocity while the other was driven at changing velocities
  according to one of three practice paradigms: serial, random blocked, or random
  training. Subjects returned to complete one of two different transfer tests. Results
  indicate that during acquisition, random practice requires unique gait mechanics
  to adapt to a challenging walking environment. Also, results from one transfer test
  close to that of the acquisition experience did not seem to demonstrate any contextual
  interference effect. Finally, random blocked practice resulted in highly unique
  changes in step length symmetry on a second, more challenging, transfer test. This
  perhaps indicates that a moderate level of contextual interference causes unique
  locomotor generalization strategies.'
