abstract: Fundamental movement skills (FMS) play a crucial role in a child’s motor
  skill development, as their mastery is related to the acquisition and mastery of
  specialized sport skills and to a child’s general health through the prevention
  of weight gain and increased level of physical activity. Thus, the accurate and
  reliable measurement of FMS is of related importance. This article presents the
  results of two studies intended to assess expert-rater agreement and inter-/intrarater
  scoring reliability in the administration of a new observational FMS instrument,
  the Furtado–Gallagher Computerized Observational Movement Pattern Assessment System
  (FG-COMPASS). In Study 1, we found that four of the six scales that underwent modifications
  in a previous study yielded acceptable expert agreement, permitting their retention
  in the revised test, while the two remaining scales measuring side sliding and leaping
  yielded insufficient expert agreement, leading to their removal from the test. In
  Study 2, weighted kappa values reflected very good interrater agreement among three
  raters across two test administrations for the Locomotor and Manipulative subtests
  and the Total score (all skills combined). Future studies should (a) collect validity
  and reliability evidence for two additional skills planned for inclusion in the
  Locomotor subtest, (b) assess the impact of varying the number of trials given when
  assessing motor skill performances in life settings, and (c) test the feasibility
  of the web-based training tool and mobile version of the instrument., Fundamental
