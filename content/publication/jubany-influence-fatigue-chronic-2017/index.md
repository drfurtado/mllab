abstract: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) has been associated with altered trunk muscle
  responses as well as increased muscle fatigability. CLBP patients and fatigued healthy
  subjects could experience similar neuromuscular strategies to attempt to protect
  the spine. The current study examined muscle activation differences between healthy
  and CLBP subjects following a perturbation. In addition, the possible role of muscle
  fatigue was evaluated by investigating the healthy control subjects in a non-fatigued
  and a fatigued condition. Both experiments were combined to evaluate possible similar
  strategies between CLBP and fatigued samples.
