abstract: '© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. Very little is known about the effects
  of specific practice on motor learning of predictive balance control during novel
  bipedal gait. This information could provide an insight into how the direction and
  magnitude of predictive errors during acquisition of a novel gait task influence
  transfer of balance control, as well as yield a practice protocol for the restoration
  of balance for those with locomotor impairments. This study examined the effect
  of a variable practice paradigm on transfer of a novel asymmetric gait pattern in
  able-bodied individuals. Using a split-belt treadmill, one limb was driven at a
  constant velocity (constant limb) and the other underwent specific changes in velocity
  (variable limb) during practice according to one of three prescribed practice paradigms:
  serial, where the variable limb velocity increased linearly; random blocked, where
  variable limb underwent random belt velocity changes every 20 strides; and random
  practice, where the variable limb underwent random step-to-step changes in velocity.
  Random practice showed the highest balance control variability during acquisition
  compared to serial and random blocked practice which demonstrated the best transfer
  of balance control on one transfer test. Both random and random blocked practices
  showed significantly less balance control variability during a second transfer test
  compared to serial practice. These results indicate that random blocked practice
  may be best for generalizability of balance control while learning a novel gait,
  perhaps, indicating that individuals who underwent this practice paradigm were able
  to find the most optimal balance control solution during practice.'
