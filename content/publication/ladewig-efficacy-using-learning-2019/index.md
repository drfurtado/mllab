abstract: Attention is very important for learning. Children are known for not paying
  much attention due to lack of selective attention resources. Selective attention
  is the ability to direct the attentional focus to a specific point in the environment,
  in order to pay attention to what is relevant (Ladewig et all, 2001). One way to
  assist children to pay more attention while teaching a task, is by using cues, that
  are one or two words, short phrases, with higher meaning to the learner. The objective
  of the current study was to test the efficacy of the cues, while school children
  performed the backhand. The statistical results of the retention test have shown,
  after 20 days rest without any practice, very high levels of significance in favor
  of the cue group, which was even able to increase the mean average from the post-test.
  On the other hand, children that did not receive cues had a decrease in performance
  in all six technical factors, from the post-test to the retention. In conclusion,
  the use of learning cues was very effective in assisting children to learn the backhand.
  Future research must continue to explore the use of cues, while teaching different
  motor skills in different contexts.
