abstract: "Objective: To clarify the impact of pre- and postnatal iron deficiency\
  \ on children's motor development. Methods: This was a longitudinal follow-up study.\
  \ A total of 114 infants (58 boys, 56 girls) born from April 2010 to December 2011\
  \ in Fuyang district of Hangzhou were enrolled. Based on cord blood and 9-month\
  \ iron status, subjects were divided into prenatal iron deficiency (34 children),\
  \ postnatal iron deficiency (37 children) and non-iron deficiency group (43 children).\
  \ Peabody Developmental Motor Scale and BOT2-simplified version were used to evaluate\
  \ the motor capacity in infants and preschoolers at 9 months, 18 months and 5 years,\
  \ respectively. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to investigate the trajectory\
  \ of motor development with age, the influence of different timing of early iron\
  \ deficiency on children's motor development, and the differences (adjusted for\
  \ possible confounding factors) in motor development in children with pre- or postnatal\
  \ iron deficiency or non-iron deficiency in different family educational environment.\
  \ Results: At the age of 9 months, 18 months and 5 years, 107, 109, and 114 children\
  \ were evaluated respectively. After controlling for a variety of confounding factors,\
  \ it was found that children with prenatal iron deficiency had significantly lower\
  \ scores of motor development compared with non-iron deficiency children (52.04\
  \ vs. 54.05 scores, β=-2.01, P=0.007), and that children with postnatal iron deficiency\
  \ had similar scores of motor development compared with non-iron deficiency children,\
  \ showing no significant difference (53.07 vs. 54.05 scores, β=-0.98, P=0.180).\
  \ Regardless of the maternal education status, prenatal iron deficiency children\
  \ always had lower motor scores than non-iron deficiency children (49.86 vs. 52.15\
  \ and 49.58 vs. 51.58 scores, β=-2.29, -2.00; P=0.031, 0.049). Among the non-iron\
  \ deficiency children, those whose mothers had a higher education level had higher\
  \ motor scores compared with those whose mothers had a lower education level (52.45\
  \ vs. 50.46 scores, β=1.99, P=0.035). Conclusions: The motor development of children\
  \ with prenatal iron deficiency did not catch up with their counterparts without\
  \ iron deficiency by 5 years of age. The results indicate the importance of preventing\
  \ iron deficiency in the fetus."
