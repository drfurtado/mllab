 abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim was to explore the timing and duration of muscle activation during a landing task in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and compare their responses to those of children who are developing typically (TD).
METHODS: Six children (ages 3-4.5 years), half with ASD, hung from a vertical bar, landed, and reacted to a light cue that signaled the child to run to the right or left or to stay in place. Electromyography and kinematics were recorded and compared between groups.
RESULTS: Children with ASD had more and longer bursts of muscle activation during preimpact. In contrast, children TD displayed more and longer burst of muscle activation during impact.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that children with ASD have a less developed landing strategy compared with their peers TD. Further investigation into the neuromuscular components in children with ASD will guide future interventions for this population.},
