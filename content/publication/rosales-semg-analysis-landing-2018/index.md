abstract: 'PURPOSE: The aim was to explore the timing and duration of muscle activation
  during a landing task in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and compare
  their responses to those of children who are developing typically (TD). METHODS:
  Six children (ages 3-4.5 years), half with ASD, hung from a vertical bar, landed,
  and reacted to a light cue that signaled the child to run to the right or left or
  to stay in place. Electromyography and kinematics were recorded and compared between
  groups. RESULTS: Children with ASD had more and longer bursts of muscle activation
  during preimpact. In contrast, children TD displayed more and longer burst of muscle
  activation during impact. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that children with ASD
  have a less developed landing strategy compared with their peers TD. Further investigation
  into the neuromuscular components in children with ASD will guide future interventions
  for this population.'
