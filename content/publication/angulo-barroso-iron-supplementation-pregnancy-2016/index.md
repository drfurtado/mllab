abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Insufficient iron levels for optimal fetal and
  infant development is a concern during pregnancy and infancy. The goal of this study
  was to assess the effects of iron supplementation in pregnancy and/or infancy on
  motor development at 9 months. METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled trial
  (RCT) of infancy iron supplementation linked to an RCT of pregnancy iron supplementation,
  conducted in Hebei, China. A total of 1482 infants were randomly assigned to receive
  placebo (n = 730) or supplemental iron (n = 752) from 6 weeks to 9 months. Gross
  motor development (assessed by using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Second
  Edition, instrument) was the primary outcome. Neurologic integrity and motor quality
  were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Motor outcome was available for 1196 infants,
  divided into 4 supplementation period groups: (1) placebo in pregnancy/placebo in
  infancy (n = 288); (2) placebo in pregnancy/iron in infancy (n = 305); (3) iron
  in pregnancy/placebo in infancy (n = 298); and (4) iron in pregnancy/iron in infancy
  (n = 305). Using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, instrument, iron supplementation
  in infancy but not pregnancy improved gross motor scores: overall, P textless .001;
  reflexes, P = .03; stationary, P textless .001; and locomotion, P textless .001.
  Iron supplementation in infancy improved motor scores by 0.3 SD compared with no
  supplementation or supplementation during pregnancy alone. Effects of iron supplementation
  in infancy alone were similar to effects with iron in both pregnancy and infancy.
  CONCLUSIONS: The RCT design supports the causal inference that iron supplementation
  in infancy, with or without iron supplementation in pregnancy, improved gross motor
  test scores at 9 months.'
