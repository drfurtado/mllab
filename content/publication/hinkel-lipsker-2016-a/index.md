abstract: © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Increased practice difficulty during asymmetrical split-belt
  treadmill rehabilitation has been shown to improve gait outcomes during retention
  and transfer tests. However, research in this area has been limited by manual treadmill
  operation. In the case of variable practice, which requires stride-by-stride changes
  to treadmill belt velocities, the treadmill control must be automated. This paper
  presents a method for automation of asymmetrical split-belt treadmill walking, and
  evaluates how well this method performs with regards to timing of gait events. One
  participant walked asymmetrically for 100 strides, where the non-dominant limb was
  driven at their self-selected walking speed, while the other limb was driven randomly
  on a stride-by-stride basis. In the control loop, the key factors to insure that
  the treadmill belt had accelerated to its new velocity safely during the swing phase
  were the sampling rate of the A/D converter, processing time within the controller
  software, and acceleration of the treadmill belt. The combination of these three
  factors resulted in a total control loop time during each swing phase that satisfied
  these requirements with a factor of safety that was greater than 4. Further, a polynomial
  fit indicated that belt acceleration was the largest contributor to changes in this
  total time. This approach appears to be safe and reliable for stride-by-stride adjustment
  of treadmill belt speed, making it suitable for future asymmetrical split-belt walking
  studies. Further, it can be incorporated into virtual reality rehabilitation paradigms
  that utilize split-belt treadmill walking.
