abstract: 'PURPOSE: To verify the association of motor skills with habitual and organized
  PA participation, and sedentary behavior for males and females. METHODS: The study
  employed a cross-sectional design in a sample of seventy-six second graders from
  a public elementary school in a Midwestern State. RESULTS: Mann Whitney and t-tests
  indicated gender differences in FMS and PA variables. Spearman correlation analyses
  demonstrated that habitual PA was correlated to total FMS, and manipulative skills
  for boys. For girls, a significant association was present in organized PA and locomotor
  skills. CONCLUSION: Choice of organized physical activity seems to influence the
  development of FMS and affect habitual PA behavior differently in boys and girls.'
