	abstract = {Objective: To clarify the impact of pre- and postnatal iron deficiency on children's motor development. Methods: This was a longitudinal follow-up study. A total of 114 infants (58 boys, 56 girls) born from April 2010 to December 2011 in Fuyang district of Hangzhou were enrolled. Based on cord blood and 9-month iron status, subjects were divided into prenatal iron deficiency (34 children), postnatal iron deficiency (37 children) and non-iron deficiency group (43 children). Peabody Developmental Motor Scale and BOT2-simplified version were used to evaluate the motor capacity in infants and preschoolers at 9 months, 18 months and 5 years, respectively. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to investigate the trajectory of motor development with age, the influence of different timing of early iron deficiency on children's motor development, and the differences (adjusted for possible confounding factors) in motor development in children with pre- or postnatal iron deficiency or non-iron deficiency in different family educational environment. Results: At the age of 9 months, 18 months and 5 years, 107, 109, and 114 children were evaluated respectively. After controlling for a variety of confounding factors, it was found that children with prenatal iron deficiency had significantly lower scores of motor development compared with non-iron deficiency children (52.04 vs. 54.05 scores, β=-2.01, P=0.007), and that children with postnatal iron deficiency had similar scores of motor development compared with non-iron deficiency children, showing no significant difference (53.07 vs. 54.05 scores, β=-0.98, P=0.180). Regardless of the maternal education status, prenatal iron deficiency children always had lower motor scores than non-iron deficiency children (49.86 vs. 52.15 and 49.58 vs. 51.58 scores, β=-2.29, -2.00; P=0.031, 0.049). Among the non-iron deficiency children, those whose mothers had a higher education level had higher motor scores compared with those whose mothers had a lower education level (52.45 vs. 50.46 scores, β=1.99, P=0.035). Conclusions: The motor development of children with prenatal iron deficiency did not catch up with their counterparts without iron deficiency by 5 years of age. The results indicate the importance of preventing iron deficiency in the fetus.},

We assessed relations between ID timing, duration, and severity and gross motor scores, neurological integrity, and motor behavior quality at 9 months.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Iron status was determined at birth and 9 months in otherwise healthy term Chinese infants. The 9-month motor evaluation included the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale (PDMS-2), Infant Neurological International Battery (INFANIB), and motor quality factor. Motor outcomes were analyzed by ID timing (fetal-neonatal, infancy), duration, and severity. For severity, we also considered maternal iron status.
RESULTS: The data were available for 1194 infants. Iron status was classified as fetal-neonatal and infancy ID (n = 253), fetal-neonatal ID (n = 256), infancy ID (n = 288), and not ID (n = 397). Compared with not ID, infants with fetal-neonatal or infancy ID had lower locomotion scores (effect size ds = 0.19, 0.18) and those with ID in both periods (longer duration) had lower locomotion and overall PDMS-2 gross motor scores (ds = 0.20, 0.18); ID groups did not differ. More severe ID in late pregnancy was associated with lower INFANIB Vestibular function (p = 0.01), and total score (p = 0.03). More severe ID in infancy was associated with lower scores for locomotion (p = 0.03), overall gross motor (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal-neonatal and/or infancy ID was associated with lower overall gross motor development and locomotion test scores at 9 months. Associations with ID severity varied by ID timing: more severe ID in late pregnancy, poorer neurological integrity; more severe ID in infancy, poorer gross motor development.},

METHODS: Six children (ages 3-4.5 years), half with ASD, hung from a vertical bar, landed, and reacted to a light cue that signaled the child to run to the right or left or to stay in place. Electromyography and kinematics were recorded and compared between groups.
RESULTS: Children with ASD had more and longer bursts of muscle activation during preimpact. In contrast, children TD displayed more and longer burst of muscle activation during impact.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that children with ASD have a less developed landing strategy compared with their peers TD. Further investigation into the neuromuscular components in children with ASD will guide future interventions for this population.},

	abstract = {Background
The relative contribution of sensory inputs to control balance while standing is dynamically adjusted. These sensory reweighting processes could be impacted by age and sport expertise capabilities, especially when the sport emphasizes equilibrium like artistic gymnastics.
Research question
The aim of this study was to explore the sensory reweighting processes to adjust standing posture in children and adults with different gymnastic expertise (gymnasts, G, and non-gymnast, NG).
Methods
All participants were asked to stand quietly on a force plate in two visual conditions (eyes open, EO, and eyes closed, EC). Within a trial, proprioception was altered with two vibrators strapped at the Achilles tendon level. The center of pressure (COP) displacements in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions were calculated and normalized by the base of support. The effect of vibration application was characterized by the COP speed, maximal posterior displacement and the time when it occurred. The effect of vibration removal was depicted by the time between the motor switched off and the achievement of balance values similar to baseline and the COP speed and movement units performed during this time.
Results
G children presented shorter posterior displacement during vibrations, needed less time to recover initial balance, and produced less movements units than NG children. In general, adults and EO showed better reweighting responses than children and EC, respectively.
Significance
These results suggest that age could have a positive effect on reweighting processes and that gymnastic experience may benefit the development of proprioceptive reweighting processes in children but not in adults.},

	abstract = {To study the interplay between motor learning and emotional responses of young infants, we developed a contingent learning paradigm that included two related, difficult, operant tasks. We also coded facial expression to characterise emotional response to learning. In a sample of nine-month-old healthy Chinese infants, 44.7\% achieved learning threshold during this challenging arm-conditioning test. Some evidence of learning was observed at the beginning of the second task. The lowest period of negative emotions coincided with the period of maximum movement responses after the initiation of the second task, and movement responses negatively correlated with the frequency of negative emotions. Positive emotions, while generally low throughout the task, increased during peak performance especially for learners. Peak frequency of movement responses was positively correlated with the frequency of positive emotions. Despite the weak evidence of learning this difficult task, our results from the learners would suggest that increasing positive emotions, and perhaps down-regulating negative emotional responses, may be important for improving performance and learning a complex operant task in infancy. Further studies are necessary to determine the role of emotions in learning difficult tasks in infancy.},

After familiarization with the learning task, participants undertook a baseline practice set. Then, four 60° clockwise rotational sets were performed, comprising an adaptation set and three retention sets at 1 h, 24 h, and 7 days after the adaptation set. Depending on the experimental group, exercise was presented before or after the adaptation sets. We found that error reduction during adaptation was similar regardless of when exercise was presented. During retention, significant error reduction was found in the retention set at 1 h for both exercise groups, but this enhancement was not present during subsequent retention sets, with no differences present between exercise groups. We conclude that an acute bout of intense exercise could positively affect retention, although the order in which exercise is presented does not appear to influence its benefits during the early stages of consolidation.},

	abstract = {Background
Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects a large proportion of the population and has been associated with different muscle dysfunctions. However, there is no consensus regarding muscle electromyography and kinematic patterns during fatiguing tasks.
Objective
To examine whether trunk and limb muscle fatigability and activation patterns of individuals suffering CLBP differ from those of healthy participants during a holding task.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Clinical research laboratory.
Participants
Twenty-four participants with CLBP and 26 matched healthy controls.
Methods
Both groups performed a static holding task, in a semisquat position, until exhaustion. The performance variable was time to failure. Electromyography signs, such as median frequency and root mean square, were used to quantify fatigability by applying linear regression to each of the 3 successive test periods. Kinematic variables were monitored throughout the holding task.
Main Outcome Measurements
Independent t tests were used to compare time to failure. Electromyography-based measures of muscle fatigability were examined through a two-way, repeated-measures analysis of variance (mixed-model), whereas kinematic analysis was based on 2 multivariate analyses of variance.
Results
Although the groups differed in time to failure (healthy group: mean 201.6 seconds, SD 98.9 seconds; CLBP: mean 132.4 seconds, SD 78.9 seconds; P =.009), no statistically significant differences were found in electromyography-based measures of muscle fatigability, except for the internal oblique muscle. Kinematic variables were similar in the 2 groups.
Conclusion
Despite similar electromyography fatigability in the 2 groups, individuals with CLBP seem to be more sensitive to certain effects of back muscle fatigue. Significant differences in electromyography measurements in the internal oblique muscle, both between groups and across periods, suggest that individuals with CLBP trigger a subtly different activation pattern to control the spine. In a holding task, compared with healthy people, this may represent a compensatory behavior aimed at adapting to certain deficits in spine control or pain.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Insufficient iron levels for optimal fetal and infant development is a concern during pregnancy and infancy. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of iron supplementation in pregnancy and/or infancy on motor development at 9 months.
METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of infancy iron supplementation linked to an RCT of pregnancy iron supplementation, conducted in Hebei, China. A total of 1482 infants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 730) or supplemental iron (n = 752) from 6 weeks to 9 months. Gross motor development (assessed by using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Second Edition, instrument) was the primary outcome. Neurologic integrity and motor quality were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Motor outcome was available for 1196 infants, divided into 4 supplementation period groups: (1) placebo in pregnancy/placebo in infancy (n = 288); (2) placebo in pregnancy/iron in infancy (n = 305); (3) iron in pregnancy/placebo in infancy (n = 298); and (4) iron in pregnancy/iron in infancy (n = 305). Using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, instrument, iron supplementation in infancy but not pregnancy improved gross motor scores: overall, P {\textless} .001; reflexes, P = .03; stationary, P {\textless} .001; and locomotion, P {\textless} .001. Iron supplementation in infancy improved motor scores by 0.3 SD compared with no supplementation or supplementation during pregnancy alone. Effects of iron supplementation in infancy alone were similar to effects with iron in both pregnancy and infancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The RCT design supports the causal inference that iron supplementation in infancy, with or without iron supplementation in pregnancy, improved gross motor test scores at 9 months.},

	abstract = {Current theories, like Ecological Dynamics, propose that inter-trial movement variability is functional when acquiring or refining movement coordination. Here, we examined how age-based experience levels of gymnasts constrained differences in emergent movement pattern variability during task performance. Specifically, we investigated different roles of movement pattern variability when gymnasts in different age groups performed longswings on a high bar, capturing the range of experience from beginner to advanced status. We also investigated the functionality of the relationships between levels of inter-trial variability and longswing amplitude during performance. One-hundred and thirteen male gymnasts in five age groups were observed performing longswings (with three different experience levels: beginners, intermediates and advanced performers). Performance was evaluated by analysis of key events in coordination of longswing focused on the arm-trunk and trunk-thigh segmental relations. Results revealed that 10 of 18 inter-trial variability measures changed significantly as a function of increasing task experience. Four of ten variability measures conformed to a U-shaped function with age implying exploratory strategies amongst beginners and functional adaptive variability amongst advanced performers. Inter-trial variability of arm-trunk coordination variables (6 of 10) conformed to a {\textbackslash}-shaped curve, as values were reduced to complete the longswings. Changes in coordination variability from beginner to intermediate status were largely restrictive, with only one variability measure related to exploration. Data revealed how inter-trial movement variability in gymnastics, relative to performance outcomes, needs careful interpretation, implying different roles as task experience changes., 
          
            
              Key points
            
            
              
                Inter-trial variability while performing longswings on a high bar was assessed in a large sample (113 participants) divided into five age groups (form beginners to advanced gymnasts). Longswing assessment allowed us to evaluate inter-trial variability in representative performance context.
              
              
                Coordination variability presented two different configurations across experience levels depending on the variable of interest: either a U-shaped or a L- or {\textbackslash}-shaped graph.
              
              
                Increased inter-trial variability of the functional phase events offered flexibility to adapt the longswing performance in the advanced gymnasts, while decreasing variability in arm-trunk coordination modes was critical to improve longswing and to achieve the most advanced level.
              
              
                In addition, the relationship between variability measures and the global performance outcome (i.e. the swing amplitude) revealed different functional roles of movement variability (exploratory or restrictive) as a function of changes in experience levels.},
