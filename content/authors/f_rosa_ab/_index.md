Rosa M. Angulo Barroso obtained her BS at the University of Barcelona (Spain). She holds a MS in biomechanics and a dual PhD in kinesiology and neural sciences from Indiana University.
She has had academic appointments at the University of Michigan and the University of Barcelona. Currently, she is a full professor in CSUN.
Her developmental Kinesiologist and neuroscientist backgrounds allow her to blend sensorimotor behavior with underlying neuroscience principles. She specializes in the motor behavior of infant and children populations, both with and without developmental problems. Her research focuses on the effects of physical rehabilitation interventions on gait, mobility, physical activity levels, and quality of life in pediatric populations. Most recently, she is interested in the relationship between physical activity and learning in children. Thus far her research has made contributions to describe and enhance levels of physical activity in pediatric populations, and to implement early treadmill training interventions in pre-locomotor infants to improve adaptive gait. Part of her research focuses on adverse effect of iron deficiency on children’s development collaborating in research projects in Costa Rica, Chile, USA, and China. She has been able to contribute to the field of iron deficiency with new knowledge about the motor development, reaching skills, activity levels of infants and children with current or former iron deficiency.
