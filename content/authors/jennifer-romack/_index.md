The Move-Learn Lab (former Motor Development Lab) was created by Dr. Romack.

Jennifer Romack, Ph.D., Professor of Kinesiology at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), passed away on Sunday, April 24th, 2016.

A huge, vibrant smile is the first thing we all think about when remembering Jennifer.  She loved and enjoyed life with family while making many scholarly contributions. She applied Benjamin Franklin’s quote to her professional activities: “Tell me and I will forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I will learn.”

In recognition of her extraordinary record and contribution to the learning experience of her students and to her field of study, Jennifer received a CSUN outstanding faculty award in 2014, She also received the CSUN Visionary Community Service-Learning Award in 2006 for her efforts in service-learning. Our hearts collectively ache for the loss of our amazing friend and colleague.
