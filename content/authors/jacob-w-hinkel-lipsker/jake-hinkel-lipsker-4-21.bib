This information could provide an insight into how the direction and magnitude of predictive errors during acquisition of a novel gait task influence transfer of balance control, as well as yield a practice protocol for the restoration of balance for those with locomotor impairments. This study examined the effect of a variable practice paradigm on transfer of a novel asymmetric gait pattern in able-bodied individuals. Using a split-belt treadmill, one limb was driven at a constant velocity (constant limb) and the other underwent specific changes in velocity (variable limb) during practice according to one of three prescribed practice paradigms: serial, where the variable limb velocity increased linearly; random blocked, where variable limb underwent random belt velocity changes every 20 strides; and random practice, where the variable limb underwent random step-to-step changes in velocity. Random practice showed the highest balance control variability during acquisition compared to serial and random blocked practice which demonstrated the best transfer of balance control on one transfer test. Both random and random blocked practices showed significantly less balance control variability during a second transfer test compared to serial practice. These results indicate that random blocked practice may be best for generalizability of balance control while learning a novel gait, perhaps, indicating that individuals who underwent this practice paradigm were able to find the most optimal balance control solution during practice.},

abstract = {Advancements in virtual reality (VR) technology now allow for the creation of highly immersive virtual environments and for systems to be commercially available at an affordable price. Despite increased availability, this access does not ensure that VR is appropriate for training for all motor skills. Before the implementation of VR for training sport-related skills takes place, it must first be established whether VR utilization is appropriate. To this end, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms that drive learning in these new environments which will allow for optimization of VR to best facilitate transfer of learned skills to the real world. In this study we sought to examine how a skill acquired in VR compares to one acquired in the real world (RW), utilizing training to complete a dart-throwing task in either a virtual or real environment. We adopted a perceptual-motor approach in this study, employing measures of task performance (i.e., accuracy), as well as of perception (i.e., visual symptoms and oculomotor behavior) and motor behaviors (i.e., throwing kinematics and coordination). Critically, the VR-trained group performed significantly worse in terms of throwing accuracy compared to both the RW-trained group and their own baseline performance. In terms of perception, the VR-trained group reported greater acute visual symptoms compared to the RW-trained group, though oculomotor behaviors were largely the same across groups. In terms of motor behaviors, the VR-trained group exhibited different dart-throwing kinematics during training, but in the follow-up test adapted their throwing pattern to one similar to the RW-trained group. In total, VR training impaired real-world task performance, suggesting that virtual environments may offer different learning constraints compared to the real world. These results thus emphasize the need to better understand how some elements of virtual learning environments detract from transfer of an acquired sport skill to the real world. Additional work is warranted to further understand how perceptual-motor behaviors are acquired differently in virtual spaces.},

Appetite hormones and appetite ratings were assessed in response to each condition. Forty minutes after both conditions, ad libitum total and relative energy intake (energy intake minus energy cost of exercise) were assessed at a buffet meal. There was no significant sex or condition effect in appetite hormones (PYY3-36, acylated ghrelin, insulin) and appetite ratings (hunger, satisfaction, fullness). Total energy intake in men was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in exercise and rest conditions (1648 ± 950, 1216 ± 633 kcal, respectively) compared with women (591 ± 183, 590 ± 231 kcal, respectively). Relative energy intake was significantly lower (P < 0.05) after exercise compared with rest in men (672 ± 827, 1133 ± 619 kcal, respectively) and women (-121 ± 243, 530 ± 233 kcal, respectively). These data highlight the effectiveness of acute exercise to suppress relative energy intake regardless of sex.},

The hip and ankle strategies that affect learning of a novel gait have not been fully determined, and could be of importance in design of clinical gait interventions. The authors' purpose was to determine the effects of asymmetric split-belt treadmill walking on ankle and hip work during propulsion. Participants were randomized into either a gradual training group or a sudden training group and later returned for a retention test. The gradual training group performed significantly more work at the hip joint of the slow limb during acquisition, and decreased the hip joint work performed during retention. These findings reveal the hip joint on the slow limb during initial swing as a possible site of adaptation to a novel locomotor pattern.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Increased practice difficulty during asymmetrical split-belt treadmill rehabilitation has been shown to improve gait outcomes during retention and transfer tests. However, research in this area has been limited by manual treadmill operation. In the case of variable practice, which requires stride-by-stride changes to treadmill belt velocities, the treadmill control must be automated. This paper presents a method for automation of asymmetrical split-belt treadmill walking, and evaluates how well this method performs with regards to timing of gait events. One participant walked asymmetrically for 100 strides, where the non-dominant limb was driven at their self-selected walking speed, while the other limb was driven randomly on a stride-by-stride basis. In the control loop, the key factors to insure that the treadmill belt had accelerated to its new velocity safely during the swing phase were the sampling rate of the A/D converter, processing time within the controller software, and acceleration of the treadmill belt. The combination of these three factors resulted in a total control loop time during each swing phase that satisfied these requirements with a factor of safety that was greater than 4. Further, a polynomial fit indicated that belt acceleration was the largest contributor to changes in this total time. This approach appears to be safe and reliable for stride-by-stride adjustment of treadmill belt speed, making it suitable for future asymmetrical split-belt walking studies. Further, it can be incorporated into virtual reality rehabilitation paradigms that utilize split-belt treadmill walking.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. When humans make errors in stepping during walking due to a perturbation, they may adapt their gait as a way to correct for discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory feedback. This study sought to determine if increased contextual interference during acquisition of a novel asymmetric gait pattern would change lower-limb mechanical strategies generalized to different walking contexts. Such knowledge could help to clarify the role of contextual interference in locomotor adaptation, and demonstrate potential use in future gait rehabilitation paradigms. One belt on a split-belt treadmill was driven at a constant velocity while the other was driven at changing velocities according to one of three practice paradigms: serial, random blocked, or random training. Subjects returned to complete one of two different transfer tests. Results indicate that during acquisition, random practice requires unique gait mechanics to adapt to a challenging walking environment. Also, results from one transfer test close to that of the acquisition experience did not seem to demonstrate any contextual interference effect. Finally, random blocked practice resulted in highly unique changes in step length symmetry on a second, more challenging, transfer test. This perhaps indicates that a moderate level of contextual interference causes unique locomotor generalization strategies.},

@article{Hinkel-Lipsker2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V. Gait adaptation is a task that requires fine-tuned coordination of all degrees of freedom in the lower limbs by the central nervous system. However, when individuals change their gait it is unknown how this coordination is organized, and how it can be influenced by contextual interference during practice. Such knowledge could provide information about measurement of gait adaptation during rehabilitation. Able-bodied individuals completed an acute bout of asymmetric split-belt treadmill walking, where one limb was driven at a constant velocity and the other according to one of three designed practice paradigms: serial practice, where the variable limb belt velocity increased over time; random blocked practice, where every 20 strides the variable limb belt velocity changed randomly; random practice, where every stride the variable limb belt velocity changed randomly. On the second day, subjects completed one of two different transfer tests; one with a belt asymmetry close to that experienced on the acquisition day (transfer 1; 1.5:1), and one with a greater asymmetry (transfer 2; 2:1). To reduce this inherently high-dimensional dataset, principal component analyses were used for kinematic data collected throughout the acquisition and transfer phases; resulting in extraction of the first two principal components (PCs). For acquisition, PC1 and PC2 were related to sagittal and frontal plane control. For transfer 1, PC1 and PC2 were related to frontal plane control of the base of support and whole-body center of mass. For transfer 2, PC1 did not have any variables with high enough coefficients deemed to be relevant, and PC2 was related to sagittal plane control. Observations of principal component scores indicate that variance structuring differs among practice groups during acquisition and transfer 1, but not transfer 2. These results demonstrate the main kinematic coordinative structures that exist during gait adaptation, and that control of sagittal plane and frontal plane motion are perhaps a trade-off during acquisition of a novel asymmetric gait pattern.},
