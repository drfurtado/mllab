I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Kinesiology. I have a Ph.D. in Human Physiology from the University of Oregon and a M.S. in Kinesiology from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. My current research interests are centered around how sensory perception (particularly vision) affects biomechanics, motor learning, and motor control of human movement. This has lead to studies investigating the role of virtual reality systems on balance control and cybersickness symptoms, as well as how fatigue impacts one's ability to walk through unfamiliar environments. While at CSUN, I have taught KIN 445-Advanced Biomechanics, KIN 477-Motor Development, KIN 479-Motor Control, and KIN 575/L-Biomechanical Analysis Techniques.
